# Design-and-implementation-of-rain-alarm-and-wind-direction-detector
A "Rain Alarm and Wind Direction Detector" project typically involves a rain sensor connected to a microcontroller (like an Arduino) to detect rainfall and trigger an alarm, alongside a wind vane and anemo-meter for wind detection. The system uses a microcontroller to process sensor data and activate a buzzer or LED when rain is detected.
